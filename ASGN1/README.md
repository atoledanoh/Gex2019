Secret Number Class
===================

Implement the Secret class. Do not modify Source.cpp or Secret.h, you
should do all of your work in Secret.cpp.

The Secret class is defined, and the program to run the game is written,
all you should do is write implementation for all of the functions in
Secret.h. If your implementation is correct running the main program
should allow you to play the guess my number game.

You can change the private class variables, but you must implement the
public API exactly as it is written.

API:

-   **Secret()** no arg constructor

-   **isWon()** Boolean function, returns true if player has won the
    current game, false otherwise.

-   **isLost()** Boolean function, returns true if player has lost the
    current game, false otherwise.

-   **isOn()** Boolean function, returns true if the game is still on,
    false if the game is over.

-   **guessesLeft()** int function, returns the number of guesses the
    player has left before they lose the game.

-   **reset()** void function, resets the game to the start of a new
    game.

**Requirements:**

-   The code must follow the class coding standard.

    -   header comment at top of each file

    -   Meaningful identifier names

        -   use camelCase

        -   capitalize Class name

        -   all caps for constants and macros (\#define, const, enum)

    -   comments throughout the code

-   The project must compile and run. **\
    **

**How to submit:**

-   Use the github classroom link to make a repository in your github
    account with this README.md file in it and the starter project

-   Clone the repository to your local computer

-   Do the assignment and commit it to your local repository

-   Push your commit to github
